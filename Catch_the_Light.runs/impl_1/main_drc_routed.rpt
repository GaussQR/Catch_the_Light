2. REPORT DETAILS

LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is r/clkdiv[27]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_13.
Related violations: <none>

LUTLP-1#2 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
18 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_n_1. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_1, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_2, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_3, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_4, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_6, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_8, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_9, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_10, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_11, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_13, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_14, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_16, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_19, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_20, r/n_0_129_BUFG_inst_i_21 (the first 15 of 18 listed).

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gameOn_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gameOn_reg_i_2/O, cell gameOn_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net r/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r/count_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell r/count_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net r/digit_reg[0][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r/led_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell r/led_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net r/flag10_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r/flag_reg_i_1/O, cell r/flag_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net r/pressed7_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r/pressed_reg_i_2/O, cell r/pressed_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net reset_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin reset_reg_i_1/O, cell reset_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s/score_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell s/score_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s/flag23_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s/flag2_reg_i_2/O, cell s/flag2_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
